Dear <%= @visit.visitors.first.first_name %>,

YOUR BOOKING REQUEST IS BEING PROCESSED

You can check the status of your request here:
<%= visit_status_url(@visit.visit_id, host: @host, protocol: @protocol) %>

We have received your visit request. We'll email you within 3 working days to confirm a date and time. Please don't contact us sooner than 3 working days, as we won't be able to comment on booking requests that are being processed.

If you donâ€™t receive a confirmation email within 3 days, please check your spam or junk folder for it. You need to do this on a computer or tablet (rather than a smart phone).

These are the options you have requested for your visit at <%= @visit.prisoner.prison_name %> for <%= @visit.visitors.size %> <%= @visit.visitors.size > 1 ? 'people' : 'person' %>:

<% @visit.slots.each_with_index do |slot, index| %>
<% if slot.date.present? %>
<%= index + 1%>. <%= Date.parse(slot.date).strftime("%A %e %B") %>, <%= display_time_slot(slot.times) %>
<% end %>
<% end %>
