Dear <%= @visit.visitors.first.first_name %>,

YOUR VISIT IS NOT BOOKED YET

You can check the status of your request here:
<%= visit_status_url(@visit.visit_id) %>

We've received your visit request. We'll email you by <%= when_to_expect_reply %> to confirm the date and time of your visit. Please don't contact us any sooner than that, as we won't be able to comment on booking requests that are being processed.

If you donâ€™t receive a confirmation email by <%= when_to_expect_reply %>, please check your spam or junk folder for it. You need to do this on a computer or tablet (rather than a smart phone).
