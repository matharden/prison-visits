  Your visit is not booked yet
%p
  You can check whether your visit has been booked on the #{link_to('visit status page', visit_status_url(@visit.visit_id))}.

  We'll email you by #{when_to_expect_reply} to confirm the date and time of your visit. Please don't contact us any sooner than that, as we won't be able to comment on booking requests that are being processed.
