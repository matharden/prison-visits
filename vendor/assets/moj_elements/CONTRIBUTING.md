# Contribution guidelines

**Note** it is assumed that this will be used in conjunction with other GOV.UK & MOJ repos. Please do _not_ add modules to this repo if it already exists in GOV.UK Elements unless there is good reason - not personal preference.

We welcome patches to the toolkit, as long as you follow these
guidelines:

Module files should be prefixed with `moj` to prevent clashes.

Make sure files are lint free and part of the build task.

Back-up code with tests where possible.

## Indentation and whitespace

2-space, soft-tabs only. No trailing whitespace.

## Versioning

We use [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/), and bump the version
on master only. Please don't submit your own proposed version numbers.

## Commit hygiene

Please see the GOV.UK [git style guide](https://github.com/alphagov/styleguides/blob/master/git.md) which describes how we prefer git history and commit messages to read.
