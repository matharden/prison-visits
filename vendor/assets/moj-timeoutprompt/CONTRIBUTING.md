# Contribution guidelines

We welcome patches to the toolkit, as long as you follow these
guidelines:

Module files should be prefixed with `moj` to prevent clashes.

Make sure files are lint free and part of the build task.

## Indentation and whitespace

Please obey the rules as per `.editorconfig`.

## Versioning

We use [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/), and bump the version
on master only. Please don't submit your own proposed version numbers.

## Commit hygiene

Please see the GOV.UK [git style guide](https://github.com/alphagov/styleguides/blob/master/git.md) which describes how we prefer git history and commit messages to read.
